## Hej!
I'm Jim, and I am a final-year computer science and engineering student. My master and specialisation is in machine learning and I enjoy projects where I can leverage my skills for meaningful purposes. 

I am currently working on my master's thesis in Data Science at Karolinska Institutet, where I analyse medical cohort data to identify key factors contributing to mortality among participants. The project involves an end-to-end machiene learning lifecylce to tune a model for binary mortality classification, and finding the most significant features behind mortality using SHAP.
